# Weapon-and-Intruder-Detection-Using-CCTV-Camera-Using-Python-Django

Weapon and Intruder detection system detect weapons and intruder from live CCTV cam footage and give alert to security departments to take immediate actions.
YOLO-v3 is used for training dataset for weapons. The UI interface is created on web to avoid the dependency of other third party program to access it. This will also helpful when need to access it over the internet using vpn setup.

# Important
The app need threading feature to work properly. Unfortunately at the moment django does not support threading. So if someone could just convert the code to flask or some other framework that support threading would really enhance the system for real life.

# I'll really appreciate any contribution in the UI or Backend.
